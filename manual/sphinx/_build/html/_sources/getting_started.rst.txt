Getting started with RADMC-3D
=============================

First steps
-----------

First you have to do this, then do ``latex document.tex``.

You should check `this` out. And of course **that**. Or *that*.

The following code sample is what you need to do ::

  latex document.tex
  open document.pdf
  python
  import bla as bl

Now this should work. We could solve :math:`\int f(x)dx`, but that
is too simple. Better would be

.. math::

   \oint f(x,y) dx dy

Now check out |radmc|.

Here is a figure:

or the following SVG image:

You can quote something::

  "Hi there, I really like this!"
