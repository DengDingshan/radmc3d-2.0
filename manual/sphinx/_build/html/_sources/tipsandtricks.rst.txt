Tips, tricks and problem hunting
********************************


Tips and tricks
===============

RADMC-3D is a large software package, and the user will in all
likelihood not understand all its internal workings. In this section we will
discuss some issues that might be useful to know when you do modeling.

* *Things that can drastically slow down ray-tracing:*

  When you create images or spectra, ``radmc3d`` will perform a ray-tracing
  calculation. You may notice that sometimes this can be very fast, but for
  other problems it can be very slow. This is because, depending on which
  physics is switched on, different ray-tracing strategies must be followed. For
  instance, if you use a dust opacity without scattering opacity (or if you
  switch dust scattering off by setting ``scattering_mode_max`` to 0 in the
  ``radmc3d.inp`` file), and you make dust continuum images, or make SEDs, this
  may go very rapidly: less than a minute on a modern computer for grids of
  256x256x256. However, when you include scattering, it may go slower. Why is
  that? That is because at each wavelength ``radmc3d`` will now have to make a
  quick Monte Carlo scattering model to compute the dust scattering source
  function. This costs time. And it will cost more time if you have
  ``nphot_scat`` set to a high value in the ``radmc3d.inp`` file, although it
  will create better images. Furthermore, if you *also* include gas lines using
  the simple LTE or simple LVG methods, then things become even slower, because
  each wavelength channel image is done after each other, and each time all the
  populations of the molecular levels have to be re-computed. If dust scattering
  would be switched off (which is for some wavelength domains presumably not a
  bad approximation; in particular for the millimeter domain), then no
  scattering Monte Carlo runs have to be done for each wavelength. Then the code
  can ray-trace all wavelength simultaneously: each ray is traced only once, for
  all wavelength simultaneously. Then the LTE/LVG level populations have to be
  computed only once at each location along the ray.  So if you use dust and
  lines simultaneously, it can be advantageous for speed if you can afford to
  switch off the dust scattering, for instance, if you model sub-millimeter
  lines in regions with dust grains smaller than 10 micron or so. If you must
  include scattering, but your model is not so big that you may get memory
  limitation problems, then you may also try the fast LTE or fast LVG modes: in
  those modes the level populations are pre-computed before the ray-tracing
  starts, which saves time. But that may require much memory.


Bug hunting
===========

Although we of course hope that ``radmc3d`` will not run into
troubles or crash, it is nevertheless possible that it will. There are
several ways by which one can hunt for bugs, and we list here a few 
obvious ones:

* In principle the ``Makefile`` should make sure that all dependencies of all
  modules are correct, so that the most dependent modules are compiled last. But
  during the further development of the code perhaps this may be not 100\%
  guaranteed. So try do ``makeclean`` followed by ``make`` (or ``makeinstall``\
  ) to assure a clean make.

* In the ``Makefile`` you can add (or uncomment) the line
  ``BCHECK=-fbounds-check``\ , if you use ``gfortran``\ .  Find the array
  boundary check switch on your own compiler if it is not ``gfortran``\ .
  
* Make sure that in the ``main.f90`` code the variable ``debug_check_all`` is
  set to 1. This will do some on-the-fly checks in the code.




Some tips for avoiding troubles and for making good models
==========================================================

Here is a set of tips that we recommend you to follow, in order to avoid
troubles with the code and to make sure that the models you make are OK.
This list is far from complete! It will be updated as we continue to
develop the code.

#. Make a separate directory for each model. This avoids confusion with
   the many input and output files from the models.

#. When experimenting: regularly keep models that work, and continue
   experimenting with a fresh model directory. If things go wrong later, you
   can always fall back on an older model that *did* work well.

#. Keep model directories within a parent directory of the code, just
   like it is currently organized. This ensures that each model is always
   associated to the version of the code for which it was developed.  If you
   update to a new version of the code, it is recommended to simply copy the
   models you want to continue with to the new code directory (and edit the
   ``SRC`` variable in the ``Makefile`` if you use the
   techniques described in Section :ref:`sec-special-purpose-compile` and
   Chapter :ref:`chap-internal-setup`).

#. If you make a new model, try to start with as clean a directory as
   possible. This avoids that you accidently have a old files hanging around,
   their presence of which may cause troubles in your new model.  So if you
   make a model update, make a new directory and then copy only the files
   that are necesary (for instance, ``problem_setup.pro``\ ,
   ``dustkappa_silicate.inp``\ , ``Makefile`` and other
   necessary files). One way of doing this easily is to write a little perl
   script or csh script that does this for you.

#. In the example model directories there is always a ``Makefile``
   present, even if no local ``*.f90`` files are present. The idea
   is that by typing {\small make cleanall} you can safely clean up the 
   model directory and restore it to pre-model status. This can be useful 
   for safely cleaning model directories so that only the model setup files
   remain there. It may save enormous amounts of disk space. But of course,
   it means that if you revisit the model later, you would need to redo
   the Monte Carlo simulations again, for instance. It is a matter of 
   choice between speed of access to results on the one hand and disk space
   on the other hand.

#. If you use LVG or escape probability to compute the level populations
   of molecules, please be aware that you must include all levels that could
   be populated, not only the levels belonging to the line you are interested
   in. 



.. _sec-things-going-wrong:

Careful: Things that might go wrong
===================================

In principle RADMC-3D should be fine-tuned such that it produced reliable
results in most circumstances. But radiative transfer modeling, like all
kinds of modeling, is not an entirely trivial issue. Extreme circumstances 
can lead to wrong results, if the user is not careful in doing various
sanity checks. This section gives some tips that you, the user, may wish
to do to check that the results are ok. This is not an exhaustive list!
So please remain creative yourself in coming up with good tests and checks.


#. *Too low number of photon packages for thermal Monte Carlo*
   
   If the number of photon packages for the thermal Monte Carlo simulation
   (Section :ref:`sec-dust-thermal-monte-carlo`) is too low, the dust
   temperatures are going to be very noisy. Some cells may even have temperature
   zero. This may not only lead to noisy images and spectra, but also simply
   wrong results. However, deep inside optically thick clouds (or protoplanetary
   disks) it will be hard to avoid this problem.  Since those regions are very
   deep below the :math:`\tau=1` surface, it might not be always too critical in
   that case. A bit of experimenting might be necessary.

#. *Too low number of photon packages for scattering*
   
   When making images or spectra in which dust scattering is important, the
   scattered light emissivity is computed by a quick Monte Carlo simulation
   before the ray-tracing (see Section :ref:`sec-scat-monte-carlo`). This
   requires the setting of the number of photon packages used for this (the
   variable ``nphot_scat`` for images and equivalently ``nphot_spec`` for
   spectra, both can be set in the ``radmc3d.inp`` file). If you see too much
   'noise' in your scattering image, you can improve this by setting
   ``nphot_scat`` to a larger value (default = 100000). If your spectrum
   contains too much noise, try setting ``nphot_spec`` to a larger value
   (default = 10000).

#. *Too optically thick cells at the surface or inner edge*
   
   You may want to experiment with grid resolution and refinement. Strictly
   speaking the transition from optically thin to optically thick, as seen both
   by the radiation entering the object and by the observer, has to occur over
   more than one cell. That is for very optically thick models, one may need to
   introduce grid refinement in various regions. As an example: an optically
   thick protoplanetary disk may have an extremely sharp thin-thick transition
   near the inner edge. To get the spectra and images right, it is important
   that these regions are resolved by the grid (note: once well inside the
   optically thick interior, it is no longer necessary to resolve individual
   optical mean free paths, thankfully). It should be said that in practice it
   is often impossible to do this in full strictness. But you may want to at
   least experiment a bit with refining the grid (using either 'separable
   refinement', see Section :ref:`sec-separable-refinement`, or AMR refinement,
   see Section :ref:`sec-amr-grid-oct-tree`). An example how wrong things can go
   at the inner edge of a protoplanetary disk, if the inner cells are not
   assured to be optically thin through grid refinement (and possibly
   additionally a bit of smoothing of the density profile too) is given in
   Fig.~:numref:`fig-innerrim-lowres`.
   
   .. _fig-innerrim-lowres:

   .. figure:: Figures/innerrim.*
               
      Example of what can go wrong with radiative transfer if the inner cells of
      a model are optically thick (i.e.\ if no grid refinement is used, see
      Section :ref:`sec-separable-refinement`). Shown here are scattered light
      images at :math:`\lambda=0.7\mu`m wavelength of the inner rim of a
      protoplanetary disk, but with the star removed with an ideal
      choronograph. The color scale is linear. The radial grid is taken to be
      logarithmically spaced with :math:`\Delta R/R=0.04`.  Left image: the
      inner cells are marginally optically thin :math:`\Delta\tau\simeq 1`,
      creating a bright inner ring, as is expected. Right image: ten times
      higher optical depth, making the inner cells optically thick with roughly
      :math:`\Delta\tau\simeq 10`, resulting in a wrong image in which the
      emission near the midplane is strongly reduced.  The reason for that is
      that the scattering source function, due to photons scattering at the
      inner 10\% of the inner cell, is diluted over the entire cell, making the
      scattered light brighness 10x lower than it should be.


#. *Model does not fit onto the grid (or onto the refined part of the grid)*
   
   The grid must be large enough to contain the entire :math:`\tau_\lambda=1`
   surface of a model at all relevant wavelengths. If you use grid refinement,
   the same is true for the :math:`\tau_\lambda=1` surface being within the
   refinened part of the grid. This is not trivial!  If you, for instance,
   import a 3-D hydrodynamic model into RADMC-3D, then it is a common problem
   that the :math:`\tau_\lambda=1` surface 'wants' to be outside of the grid (or
   outside of the higher-resolution part of the :math:`\theta`-grid if you use
   separable grid refinement: see Fig.~:ref:`fig-spher-sep-ref`). For example:
   if you make a * hydrodynamic* model of a protoplanetary disk in :math:`R`,
   :math:`\Theta` and :math:`\Phi` coordinates, you typically want to model only
   the lower 2 pressure scale heights of the disk, since that contains 99.5\% of
   the mass of the disk. However, for *radiative transfer* this may not be
   enough, since if the disk has an optical depth of :math:`\tau=10^3`, the
   optically thin surface layer is less than :math:`0.1\%` of the disk mass,
   meaning that you need to model the lower 3 (not 2!) pressure scale
   heights. Simply inserting the hydrodynamics model with the first 2 scale
   heights would lead to an artifical cut-off of the disk. In other words, the
   real :math:`\tau_\lambda=1` surface 'wants' to be outside of the grid (or
   outside of the refined part of the grid). This leads to wrong results.



Common technical problems and how to fix them
=============================================

When using a complex code such as RADMC-3D there are many ways you might
encounter a problem. Here is a list of common issues and tips how to fix them.

#. *After updating RADMC-3D to a new version, some setups don't work anymore.*
   
   This problem can be due to several things:

   * When your model makes a local ``radmc3d`` executable (see Section
     :ref:`sec-special-purpose-compile`), for instance when you use the
     ``userdef_module.f90`` to set up the model, then you may need to edit the
     ``SRC`` variable in the ``Makefile`` again to point to the new code
     directory, and type ``makeclean`` followed by ``make``\ .
     
   * Are you sure to have recompiled ``radmc3d`` again *and* installed it (by
     going in ``src/`` and typing ``makeinstall``\ )?
     
   * Try going back to the old version and recheck that the model works well
     there. If that works, and the above tricks don't fix the problem, then it
     may be a bug. Please contact the author.

#. *After updating RADMC-3D to a new version: the new features are not present/working.*
   
   Maybe again the ``Makefile`` issue above.

#. *After updating RADMC-3D to a new version: model based on userdef_module fails to compile*
   
   If you switch to a new version of the code and try to 'make' an earlier model
   that uses the userdef_module.f90, it might sometimes happen that the
   compilation fails because some subroutine ``userdef_***`` is not known (here
   ``***`` is some name). Presumably what happened is that a new user-defined
   functionality has been added to the code, and the corresponding subroutine
   ``userdef_***`` has been added to the ``userdef_module.f90``\ . If, however,
   in your own ``userdef_module.f90`` this subroutine is not yet built in, then
   the compiler can't find this subroutine and complains. Solution: just add a
   dummy subroutine to your ``userdef_module.f90`` with that name (have a look
   at the ``userdef_module.f90`` in the ``src/`` directory).  Then recompile and
   it should now work.

#. *While reading an input file, RADMC-3D says 'Fortran runtime error: End of file'*
   
   This can of course have many reasons. Some common mistakes are:

   * In ``amr_grid.inp`` you may have specified the coordinates of the nx*ny*nz
     grid centers instead of (nx+1)*(ny+1)*(nz+1) grid cell interfaces.
     
   * You may have no line feed at the end of one of the ascii input files.  Some
     fortran compilers can read only lines that are officially ended with a
     return or line feed. Solution: Just write an empty line at the end of such
     a file.

#. *My changes to the main code do not take effect*
   
   Did you type, in the ``src/`` directory, the full ``makeinstall``\ ? If you
   type just ``make``\ , then the code is compiled but not installed as the
   default code.

#. *My userdef_module.f90 stuff does not work*
   
   If you run ``radmc3d`` with own userdefined stuff, then you must make sure to
   run the right executable. Just typing ``radmc3d`` in the shell might cause
   you to run the standard compilation instead of your special-purpose one. Try
   typing ``./radmc3d`` instead, which forces the shell to use the local
   executable.

#. *When I make images from the command line, they take very long*
   
   If you make images with ``radmc3dimage`` (plus some keywords) from the
   command line, the default is that a flux-conserving method of ray-tracing is
   used, which is called recursive sub-pixeling (see Section
   :ref:`sec-image-refinement`). You can make an image without sub-pixeling with
   the command-line option ``nofluxcons``\ . That goes much faster, and also
   gives nice images, but the flux (the integral over the entire image) may
   not be accurate.

#. *My line channel maps (images) look bad*
   
   If you have a model with non-zero gas velocities, and if these gas velocities
   have cell-to-cell differences that are larger than or equal to the intrinsic
   (thermal+microturbulent) line width, then the ray-tracing will not be able to
   pick up signals from intermediate velocities. In other words, because of the
   discrete gridding of the model, only discrete velocities are present, which
   can cause numerical problems. There are two possible solutions to this
   problem. One is the wavelength band method described in Section
   :ref:`sec-wavelength-bands`.  But a more systematic method is the 'doppler
   catching' method described in Section :ref:`sec-doppler-catching` (which can
   be combined with the wavelength band method of Section
   :ref:`sec-wavelength-bands` to make it even more perfect).

#. *My line spectra look somewhat noisy*
   
   If you include dust continuum scattering (Section :ref:`sec-scattering`) then
   the ray-tracer will perform a scattering Monte Carlo simulation at each
   wavelength. If you look at lines where dust scattering is still a strong
   source of emission, and if ``nphot_scat`` (Section
   :ref:`sec-scat-monte-carlo`) is set to a low value, then the different random
   walks of the photon packages in each wavelength channel may cause slightly
   different resulting fluxes, hence the noise.

#. *My dust continuum images look very noisy/streaky: many 'lines' in the image*
   
   There are two possible reasons:

   #. *Photon noise in the thermal Monte Carlo run:* If you have too few photon
      packages for the thermal Monte Carlo computation (see Chapter
      :ref:`chap-dust-transfer`), then the dust temperatures are simply not well
      computed. This may give these effects. You must then increase ``nphot`` in
      the ``radmc3d.inp`` file to increase the photon statistics for the thermal
      Monte Carlo run.
      
   #. *Photon noise in the scattering Monte Carlo run:* If you are making an
      image at a wavelength at which the disk is not emitting much thermal
      radiation, then what you will see in the image is scattered light.
      ``RADMC-3D`` makes a special Monte Carlo run for scattered light before
      each image. This Monte Carlo run has its own variable for setting the
      number of photon packages: ``nphot_scat``\ . If this value is set too low,
      then you can see individual 'photon'-trajectories in the image, making the
      image look bad. It is important to note that this can only be remedied by
      increasing ``nphot_scat`` (in the ``radmc3d.inp`` file, see Section
      :ref:`sec-scat-monte-carlo`), not by setting ``nphot`` (which is the
      number of photon packages for the thermal Monte Carlo computation). Please
      also read Section :ref:`sec-single-multiple-scattering` for a detailed
      discussion about the effects of multiple scattering and the possibility of
      it leading to streaks in the images.

   However, it might also mean that something is wrong with the setup. A few
   common setup-errors that could cause these issues are:

   * Accidently created a way too massive object. Let us discuss this with an
     example of a protoplanetary disk: suppose you created, in spherical
     coordinates, not a protoplanetary disk with
     :math:`M_{\mathrm{disk}}=0.01\,M_{\odot}` but accidently one with
     :math:`M_{\mathrm{disk}}=10\,M_{\odot}`. In such a case a lot of things
     will go wrong. First of all the inner edge of the disk will almost
     certainly behave strangely (see Fig.~:ref:`fig-innerrim-lowres`). Secondly,
     the surface of the disk will almost certainly be cut-off in the way
     decribed in Section :ref:`sec-things-going-wrong`, in which case the
     surface of the disk will be hardly illuminated by the star, because the
     disk surface is then exactly conical (i.e.\ starlight will not be able to
     impinge on the surface). This will lead to very low photon statistics at
     the surface.
