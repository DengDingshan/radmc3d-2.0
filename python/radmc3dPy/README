INSTALLATION
------------

1) Standard global python install with distutils (sudo/root privileges are needed)

    $>python setup.py install

This will install radmc3dPy to the standard python directory (/usr/..../site-packages or
    /opt/..../site-packages for a standard python installation in most unix/linux systems)

2) Standard local python install with distutils (without root privileges)
    
    $>python setup.py install --user

    This will install radmc3dPy to $HOME/.local/lib/python3.X/site-packages or 
    $HOME/.local/lib/python2.X/site-packages depending on the python version used.

    Alternatively it is also possible to install radmc3dPy to an arbitrary directory by using the --prefix option:
    
    $>python setup.py install --prefix=DIR

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

radmc3dPy relies on several auxiliary but widely used python packages:

    matplotlib      - used for visualization/plotting
    numpy           - used for array operations
    astropy.io.fits - previously known as PyFits, ython library for fits file handling
    
TROUBLE SHOOTING:
-----------------

If you have used an earlier version of RADMC-3D and/or radmc3dPy, make sure
that there is no old version of radmc3dPy conflicting with your current one:
check that there is NO directory

  $HOME/bin/python/radmc3dPy/

If there is, then do this:

  cd $HOME/bin/python
  mv radmc3dPy old_radmc3dPy

Explanation: In version 0.41 of RADMC-3D, the radmc3dPy package was put
there. But in version 2.0 of RADMC-3D, the radmc3dPy package is installed
straight into your Python distribution. To avoid a mix-up (given that the
$HOME/bin/python/ directory will be in your PYTHONPATH), you need to remove the
one in $HOME/bin/python. Note that with the new installation method, you can
still use radmc3dPy with version 0.41 of RADMC-3D or older.
