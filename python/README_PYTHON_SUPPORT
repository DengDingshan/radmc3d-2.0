The core of the RADMC-3D package is written in Fortran-90. But all the
interaction and operation of RADMC-3D is done through Python. Essentially
you will use Python scripts to create a set of input files for RADMC-3D.
Then you will run the RADMC-3D executable (called 'radmc3d'). This will
create a set of output files. You will use Python scripts to read these
output files and analyze and plot the results.

There are two main ways to interact with RADMC-3D through Python:

 - In the ../examples/ directory you find basic setups for simple models.  Each
   directory contains one or more python scripts to set the model up
   (i.e. create the input files for the models). These example scripts are kept
   as simple as possible, so that it becomes clear what RADMC-3D is really
   doing.

 - In the ./radmc3dPy/ directory you find a package, developed by Dr. Attila
   Juhasz between 2011 and 2018, which has a large number of functions and
   methods to read RADMC-3D data, process them, and make plots of them.
   From 2020 onward (and starting with version 2.0 of RADMC-3D) it will
   be maintained by Cornelis Dullemond. The radmc3dPy package has its
   own documentation, independent of the main RADMC-3D documentation.
