The core of the RADMC-3D package is written in Fortran-90. But all the
interaction and operation of RADMC-3D is done through Python. Essentially
you will use Python scripts to create a set of input files for RADMC-3D.
Then you will run the RADMC-3D executable (called 'radmc3d'). This will
create a set of output files. You will use Python scripts to read these
output files and analyze and plot the results.

There are three main ways to interact with RADMC-3D through Python:

 - In the ../examples/ directory you find basic setups for simple models.  Each
   directory contains one or more python scripts to set the model up
   (i.e. create the input files for the models). These example scripts are kept
   as simple as possible, so that it becomes clear what RADMC-3D is really
   doing.

 - In the ./radmc3d_basic_tools/ directory you find some python tools that you
   can use to analyze or plot the input files and output files.

 - In the ./radmc3dPy/ directory you find a package, developed by Dr. Attila
   Juhasz, which includes much more than just a basic set of tools. It is
   therefore a more sophisticated Python interface to RADMC-3D. The only
   drawback is that it is no longer maintained or further developed, as
   Dr. Juhasz has left science. Attempts will be made to keep this package
   alive (i.e. making small changes necessary to keep it working, while Python
   and RADMC-3D continue to develop). This package has its own documentation
   and it contains copies of some of the example models internally.
