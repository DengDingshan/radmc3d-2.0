# to get the "circular image". Circular images (available only for
# models in spherical coordinates) are pixel arrangements that are
# not as rows and columns, but instead as concentric circles. This 
# can be useful for models with radial coordinates spanning a huge
# range (from very small r to very large r, several orders of 
# magnitude). For circular images we do not need "subpixeling"
# or "zoom ins", because the pixels are arranged in circles, each
# corresponding to a radial coordinate of the model. So this "zoom
# in" is automatic: all scales are represented in one "circular
# image". They are also useful for 1-D models, since 2-D images of
# 1-D spherically symmetric models are overkill: we only need to 
# compute the intensity as a function of impact parameter. So for
# 1-D models the circular images have no subdivision in phi, but
# only intensity as a function of r. That makes it, as a bonus,
# also much faster.
#
# Here we overplot the result of the spherical image with that
# of the (normal) rectangular image.
