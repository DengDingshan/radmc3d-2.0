This is a version of the run_simple_1/ model, but now with a layer-style
grid refinement demonstrated.

This directory should contain the following files: 

  README                         (This file)
  Makefile                       (Only for convenient cleanmodel and cleanall)
  dustkappa_silicate.inp         (some dust opacity file)
  problem_setup.py               (a Python script for setting up some input files)
  problem_plotexample.py         (a Python script for displaying an image)

This is what the model does:

  The model sets up a simple Gaussian blob of dust surrounding a star in a
  3-D cartesian grid. It is the same model as the one in run_simple_1/
  but this time with a refined grid patch (a "layer") near the center
  which has a 2x finer spatial resolution.

This is what you should do to run this model:

  1) Make sure you have compiled the main radmc3d code in src/ already.
  2) Type in the shell 'python problem_setup.py'
  3) In the shell type 'radmc3d mctherm' and wait until this is finished
  4) Go into Python (e.g. ipython --matplotlib)
  7) Inside Python type '%run problem_plotexample.py'

This should show an image of the model pole-on, so that the boxy grid
structure becomes visible. If you look closely, you will see that the
grid blocks in the outer parts of the image are larger than the ones
near the center, by a factor of 2. This is the effect of the grid
refinement in the layer.

Have a look at problem_setup.py (and the differences to the same file
in run_simple_1/) to see how the refinement "layer" was included here.
