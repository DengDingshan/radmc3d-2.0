This is a simple 2-D envelope model with a density dependence of the
theta-coordinate: the density is high near the equatorial plane, and
drops off as a Gaussian toward the poles.

NOTE: Dust scattering is switched off in this model. But this can easily
      be switched back on (see scattering_mode_max in problem_setup.py).

This directory should contain the following files: 

  README                         (This file)
  Makefile                       (Only for convenient cleanmodel and cleanall)
  dustkappa_silicate.inp         (some dust opacity file)
  problem_setup.py               (a python script for setting up some input files)
  plot_structure.py              (an example of displaying the density and temperature structure)
  plot_images.py                 (an example of creating and showing images)
  plot_spectra.py                (an example of creating and showing SEDs)

This is what the model does:

  It puts a spherical envelope of dust around a star and computes the
  temperature structure of the envelope. You can then make spectra and
  images.

This is what you should do to run this model:

  1) Make sure you have compiled the main radmc3d code in src/ already.
     See manual for how to compile.
     
  2) Type python problem_setup.py in the linux/unix shell. This should
     set up your model. You need, of course, a working installation of
     Python on your system.
     
  3) In the shell type:

      radmc3d mctherm

     This will compute the self-consistent dust temperature.
     
  4) Now you can make plots. Go into Python (e.g. ipython --matplotlib).
  
     4a) Type %run plot_structure.py for displaying the density and
         temperature structure.
         
     4b) Type %run plot_images.py for an example of creating and displaying
         images of the model seen at lambda=10 micron and inclination 60 deg.
         Note that radmc3d is called from within this script.

     4c) Type %run plot_spectra.py for an example of creating and plotting
         the spectral energy distribution (SED) at inclination of 60 deg.
     
Note: The plot_images.py and plot_spectra.py also demonstrates the use of
      "circular images".

NOTE: This model is very simple. It has the weakness that the radial grid
      is not sufficiently resolved near the inner edge. See the RADMC-3D
      manual for more information about grid resolution, in particular
      inner-edge grid resolution. And see run_spher2d_2/ for an example
      of radial grid refinement.

Note: Compared to the model in version 0.41, this model has a slightly
      wider theta-grid (zmaxr=0.7 instead of 0.5).
