Now let us test what happens if the local line width is too small compared
to the velocity gradient over each cell. We take a problem with a linear
gradient in y-direction of v_y and a very narrow intrinsic line width
compared to the overall velocity gradient. You will find that you get
good images if you use the doppler catching mode, but it will go entirely
wrong without it (sometimes the line emission does not even appear at
all without doppler catching).

So, first compile RADMC-3D of course. Then

  python problem_setup.py

Now, in Python, you can:

  %run problem_plotexample.py

which shows two images: one created without doppler catching, one with.
In the one without doppler catching, you do not see any line emission
whatsoever. Only the (very weak) dust continuum emission and the star
are seen. But with doppler catching, the line emission is very bright,
and saturated to the Planck function.
